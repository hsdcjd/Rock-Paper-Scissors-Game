# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
(A Digital Futures Academy Challenge, March 2023)

What was the task:
----

The DFA team have asked you to provide a game for them. The daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to have a little fun.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

### Acceptance Criteria
```
As a DFAT member
So that I can see my name
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a DFAT member
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality

- the DFAT member should be able to enter their name before the game
- the DFAT member will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the DFAT member can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors

- Paper beats Rock
